<?php phpinfo();


/*
phpinfo() is good to know to for the following:
# PHP configuration - It displays information about PHP modules, extensions, directives and various settings.
# version information - Make sure you are up-to-date with the php installation
# environment details - info about the server, such as os, software and loaded modules. Good for finding compatibility issues
# security - Helps you identify potential security risks
# debugging and development - As it shows insight into the php setup
# server administration - more relevant with multiple environments


Display errors (if script is run without server)
# display_errors => STDOUT => STDOUT

Display errors (if script is run with server (PhpStorm))
# Display errors is "ON" in both local and master value


Document root is;
# "The document root directory under which the current script is executing, as defined in the server's configuration file." (https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php)
# $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] => C:\Users\carsten\PhpstormProjects\IS_115PHP
